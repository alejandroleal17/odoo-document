# Kubernetes Commands Usage Guide - Navigator Cluster

This manual provides detailed instructions on how to use essential Kubernetes commands (`kubectl`) for managing and observing pods in different namespaces, as well as executing commands and tasks within the pods.

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` installed and configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Access to the Kubernetes cluster where the pods and services are running.

## Retrieving Pod Information

### Listing Pods in a Namespace

To get a list of all the pods in a specific namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n internal get pods
```

Replace `internal` with the desired namespace name.

### Describing a Pod

To view the detailed description of a specific pod:

```bash
kubectl -n internal describe pod logstash-logstash-0
```

Replace `logstash-logstash-0` with the desired pod name.

### Viewing Pod Logs

To view the logs of a specific pod:

```bash
kubectl -n internal logs dataintegrator-worker-production-d6754d94f-s68px
```

Replace `dataintegrator-worker-production-d6754d94f-s68px` with the desired pod name.

## Interacting with Pods

### Connecting to a Pod

To connect to a pod and open an interactive shell inside it:

```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty dataintegrator-worker-production-66ff9d7675-zlvts -n production -- /bin/bash
```

Replace `dataintegrator-worker-production-66ff9d7675-zlvts` with the desired pod name.

### Executing Tasks Inside a Worker

To run a specific task inside a pod:

1. Connect to the pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec --stdin --tty dataintegrator-worker-dev-84cc998454-9d49w -n dev -- /bin/bash
   ```
2. Once inside the pod, execute the command for the task:
   ```bash
   di --program=epson --task=epson_store_ranking --debug â€”no-worker
   ```

## Exporting Logs to a File

To export the logs of a pod to a file on your local system:

1. For a pod in the `production` namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n production logs dt-xfinity-ltm-transactions-cj-28301370-fvd22 > log_ltm_trans.txt
   ```
2. For a pod in the `dev` namespace:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev logs dataintegrator-dev-c8f6b9fd6-99g2r > Log_dataintegrator-dev-99g2r.txt
   ```
3. For another pod in `dev`:
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev logs dataintegrator-worker-production-668486f477-8s2hz > epson_store_ranking01.txt
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Replace pod and namespace names with those corresponding to your specific environment and needs.
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to execute these commands in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Refer to the official `kubectl` documentation for more details and advanced options of these commands.

This guide provides you with the basic tools for managing and observing pods in Kubernetes, as well as interacting with them and exporting their logs for further analysis.
