# Stern Usage Guide for Observing Logs in Kubernetes - Navigator Cluster

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the `stern` tool for observing and filtering pod logs in a Kubernetes cluster, particularly for tracking services like `dataintegrator` and `navigator-api` across different environments (production, staging, development).

## Prerequisites

- `stern` installed on your machine.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Configured `kubectl` and access to the Kubernetes cluster where the services are running.

## Basic Log Observation

### In Production

To observe logs from `dataintegrator-production-*` in the `production` namespace:

```bash
./stern -n production dataintegrator-production-*
```

To observe logs from `dataintegrator-worker-production-*` in `production`:

```bash
./stern -n production dataintegrator-worker-production-*
```

To observe logs from `navigator-api-production-*` in `production`:

```bash
./stern -n production navigator-api-production-*
```

### In Staging

To observe logs from `dataintegrator-production-*` in the `staging` namespace:

```bash
./stern -n staging dataintegrator-production-*
```

### In Development

To observe logs from `dataintegrator-production-*` in the `dev` namespace:

```bash
./stern -n dev dataintegrator-production-*
```

## Log Filtering

To filter and validate a specific log, you can use `grep`. For example, to filter logs from `navigator-api-production-*` in `production` for a specific validation:

```bash
./stern -n production navigator-api-production-* | grep "specific_validation"
```

Replace `"specific_validation"` with the specific text string you are looking for in the logs.

## Additional Tips

- **Regular Expressions**: `stern` supports the use of regular expressions to specify pods, allowing great flexibility in log selection.

- **Real-time Logging**: `stern` displays logs in real-time, which is useful for live debugging and monitoring.

- **Log History**: By default, `stern` retrieves the last 100 lines of logs. You can change this behavior with the `--tail` flag.

- **Stern Help**: For more options and assistance, run `stern --help`.

This guide should provide you with a clear understanding of how to use `stern` for monitoring and filtering logs in a Kubernetes environment. Be sure to adapt the commands and filters to the specific needs of your environment and applications.
