# Architecture

In our continuous effort to enhance clarity and understanding of Navigator's architecture, we have adopted the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) as our primary framework for architectural visualization and documentation. The C4 model, conceptualized by Simon Brown, offers a comprehensive approach to describing software architecture, breaking it down into four distinct levels: Context, Containers, Components, and Code.
