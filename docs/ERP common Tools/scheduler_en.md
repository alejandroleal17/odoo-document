### What is the Scheduler in Odoo?
The Scheduler is a tool that allows you to automate periodic tasks in Odoo. You can schedule actions to run automatically at specific intervals.

### Steps to use the Scheduler:

### 1. Access the Configuration Panel:
   - Log in to your Odoo instance as an administrator.
   - Go to the Settings Panel by clicking on the settings icon in the upper right corner.

### 2. Configure Scheduled Tasks:
   - Once in the Settings Panel, search and select "Technical".
   - Then, select "Automation" and then "Scheduled Tasks".

### 3. Create a New Scheduled Task:
   - Click the "Create" button to add a new scheduled task.
   - Complete the required fields, such as task name, target model, method to execute, time interval, etc.
   - Define when you want the task to run (for example, daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Save the settings.

### 4. Execute and Verify the Task:
   - Once the scheduled task is configured, the Odoo Scheduler will execute the action automatically according to the specified interval.
   - You can check the status and execution records of tasks in the "Scheduled Tasks" list.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust:
   - Regularly monitor scheduled tasks to ensure they are running correctly and according to your needs.
   - If necessary, adjust the configuration of existing tasks or create new tasks according to changes in business requirements.

### 6. Predefined Scheduled Tasks:
   - Odoo provides some predefined scheduled tasks for common tasks such as updating prices, sending automatic emails, generating reports, etc.
   - You can explore these predefined options and customize them as needed.

### 7. Test in Development Environment:
   - Before implementing new scheduled tasks in your production environment, it is advisable to test them in a development environment to avoid possible errors or unwanted impacts.

### 8. Documentation and Support:
   - Always consult the official Odoo documentation and seek support from the community if you encounter difficulties when configuring or using the Scheduler.

### 9. Maintenance:
   - Perform regular maintenance of the Scheduler, reviewing and updating scheduled tasks as necessary to ensure their effectiveness and continued relevance.
