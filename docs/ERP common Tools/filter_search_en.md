</center>

Odoo offers powerful filtering, searching and grouping tools that allow you to quickly find the information you need in different applications. Here's a step-by-step guide to get the most out of these features:

### **1. Record Filtering:**

- **Step 1:** Access the corresponding application in Odoo, such as Sales, Purchases, Inventory, etc.

- **Step 2:** Once inside the application, you will see a list of records (for example, sales orders, products, invoices, etc.).

- **Step 3:** To filter the records, look for the "Filter" or "Advanced Filters" button (usually represented with a funnel or magnifying glass).

- **Step 4:** Select the filtering criteria you want to apply. For example, you can filter by status (open, pending, completed), date, customer, product, etc.

- **Step 5:** Apply the filters and you will see the list update to show only records that meet the selected criteria.

### **2. Records Search:**

- **Step 1:** Within the corresponding application, look for the search bar at the top of the page.

- **Step 2:** Enter the term you want to search. You can search by name, code, description or other relevant fields.

- **Step 3:** Press Enter or click on the search icon to run the search.

- **Step 4:** Odoo will display the records that match your search term in the main list.

### **3. Grouping of Records:**

- **Step 1:** As with the previous steps, access the application and display the list of records.

- **Step 2:** Look for the "Group by" or "Group & Filter" button (often represented with a grouping function or list icon).

- **Step 3:** Select the field by which you want to group the records. For example, you can group sales orders by customer, products by category, invoices by status, etc.

- **Step 4:** Once the grouping field is selected, Odoo will organize the records into groups based on that field.
