## Guide for Verification and Confirmation by WHOP in Odoo

In Odoo, the verification and confirmation process by WHOP (Warehouse Operations Personnel) involves reviewing and validating delivery orders before confirming them and proceeding with the delivery of the products. Below is a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Access the Inventory application**

Log in to your Odoo account and go to the “Inventory” app from the main menu.

**Step 2: Search for Pending Delivery Orders**

1. In the Inventory app, select the option to view delivery orders.
2. Search and filter pending delivery orders that need to be verified and confirmed.

**Step 3: Check Product Availability**

For each pending delivery order, the WHOP must verify the availability of the products in the warehouse. This involves ensuring there is enough stock available to fulfill the order.

**Step 4: Confirm the Delivery Order**

Once the availability of the products has been verified, the WHOP can confirm the delivery order. Follow these steps:

1. Select the delivery order you want to confirm.
2. Review the order details to make sure they are correct.
3. Click the "Confirm" button or similar option to confirm the delivery order.

**Step 5: Assign FedEx Tracking Number**

After confirming the delivery order, WHOP must assign a FedEx tracking number for the shipment. This allows the package to be tracked during transport.

1. Within the confirmed delivery order, look for a section or field designated for the FedEx tracking number.
2. Enter the tracking number provided by FedEx for this shipment.

**Step 6: Notify CCO**

It is important to notify the CCO (Chief Commercial Officer) of the delivery order confirmation and provide the FedEx tracking number so they can inform the customer. This can be done by mentioning the CCO on the delivery order or by sending them an email notification.

**Step 7: Finish Process**

Once the above steps are completed, the WHOP verification and confirmation process is complete. The products are ready to be shipped to the customer and the CCO can inform them about the shipment status and provide them with the FedEx tracking number for tracking.
