## Guide to Create a Sales Order in Odoo

Creating a sales order in Odoo is a simple process that allows you to manage your business transactions efficiently. Follow the following steps to create a sales order:

**Step 1: Log in to Odoo**

Access your Odoo account using your username and password.

**Step 2: Navigate to the Sales application**

Once you're logged in, find and select the "Sales" app from the Odoo main menu.

**Step 3: Create a New Sales Order**

Within the Sales application, click the "Create" button to begin the process of creating a new sales order.

**Step 4: Complete Sales Order Details**

Fill in the details required for the sales order:

- **Customer:** Select the customer for whom you are creating the sales order. You can search for existing clients in the Odoo database or create a new one if necessary.
  
- **Products:** Add the products that the customer wants to buy to the sales order. You can search the products in the Odoo product catalog and specify the desired quantity for each product.

- **Quantity and Price:** Indicates the quantity of each product that the customer is requesting and the corresponding unit price. Odoo will automatically calculate the total based on the quantity and price.

- **Delivery Date:** If relevant, specify the date on which the products are expected to be delivered to the customer.

**Step 5: Review and Confirm the Sales Order**

Once you have completed all the sales order details, review the information to make sure it is accurate. Once satisfied, you can save the order as a draft or confirm it directly.

- **Save as Draft:** If you need to make more changes or review the order before confirming it, save the order as a draft. You can come back later to complete and confirm it.

- **Confirm Sales Order:** If you are sure of the order details and are ready to proceed, confirm the sales order. Once confirmed, the order will be sent to the next step in the sales process, such as generating a delivery order.

**Step 6: Sales Order Tracking**

Once confirmed, you can track the progress of the sales order in Odoo. From the Sales app, you can access the list of sales orders and see the status of each one, as well as any additional actions that need to be taken, such as billing or delivery.

And that's it! By following these steps, you can easily create a sales order in Odoo and keep an efficient track of your business transactions.
