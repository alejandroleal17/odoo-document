### Guide for Automatic Creation of a Delivery Order in Odoo

In Odoo, you can configure your system to automatically generate delivery orders based on the sales orders created. Follow these steps to set up automatic creation of delivery orders:

**Step 1: Access the Sales application**

Log in to your Odoo account and go to the “Sales” app from the main menu.

**Step 2: Set Up Automatic Delivery Rules**

1. In the Sales app, click "Settings" in the top toolbar.
2. Select "Sales Settings".
3. Find the "Deliveries" or "Delivery Orders" section and activate the "Create a delivery order for each confirmed order line" option.
   
    This setup ensures that every time a sales order is confirmed, a corresponding delivery order will be automatically generated.

**Step 3: Create a Sales Order**

Create a sales order as you normally would in Odoo. Enter customer details, products ordered and any other relevant information.

**Step 4: Confirm the Sales Order**

Once you have completed the sales order details, confirm it to send it to the next step in the process.

**Step 5: Generate the Delivery Order**

After confirming the sales order, Odoo will automatically generate a delivery order as a draft. This delivery order will contain the same products and quantities as the corresponding sales order.

**Step 6: Review and Confirm the Delivery Order**

1. Access the Inventory application from the main menu.
2. Search and select the newly generated delivery order.
3. Review the delivery order details to make sure they are correct.
4. Confirm the delivery order to finish the process.

**Step 7: Delivery Process**

Once the delivery order is confirmed, you can proceed with the process of packaging and shipping the products to the customer. You can record tracking information and any other relevant information within the delivery order in Odoo.
